# SPACE GLADIATORS JAVASCRIPT RPG

## General informations

1. Brief

I wanted to create an RPG using JS to improve my skills and have fun the same time. I started my web dev journey at the end of 2019.
As this is my first project keep in mind that code will change a lot and probably I might do many mistakes.

2. Game concept

Space gladiator 1.0 is going to be an simple turn-based rpg. As a young gladiator you will try your luck on galactic arena.

3. Version 1.0 main goals

- There should be a few leagues with different difficulty level. You will start with basic attack skill on lvl one.

- I would like to include 10 different races. Each race has strength and weaknesses and that will determine your character.

- Biggest challange might be a skills system - thats why in ver 1.0 I am going to focus on a basic fight mechanics without extra skills

- Based on svg-s system of avatar creation. Each portrait will be created based on race. I will illustrate specific parts like headshape,
  eyebrows, chin, nose etc. Each random enemy should be different.
